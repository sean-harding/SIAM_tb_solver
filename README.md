# 1.)The main thread is contained within "main.py" and is to be run with python3
# The relevant parameters for the model are to be changed in this file
#
# 2.)As the calculation progreses, the code will dump information about the progress to "out.txt" which can be used to monitor it
#
# 3.)The code to calculate the spectral function using Chebyshev polynomials is contained in "spectral.py" and is supposed to be
#    run seperately at the minute to allow exploration of the Chebyshev method. Again, relevant parameters are to be accessed
    here
